# qdp-android

The Android app's core. The app itself is in
[`android`](../../android/README.md).

It's part of [QDP](../../README.md): the
[architecture overview](../../docs/architecture.md) shows how the crates fit
together. It's internal to QDP, with no stable API.

API documentation: `cargo doc -p qdp-android --open`
